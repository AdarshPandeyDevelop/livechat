Live Chat Application – Real-Time Messaging Platform
Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io

Built a real-time chat application enabling seamless, two-way communication between multiple users through WebSocket-based connections using Socket.io. The application is designed to handle concurrent connections, providing live message broadcasting in public chatrooms with minimal latency.

The backend architecture is developed with Node.js and Express, where Socket.io manages client connections through an event-based system. Messages are emitted and listened to using custom events, enabling real-time updates without the need for page reloads. By leveraging Node.js streams, the application handles continuous data flow efficiently, improving scalability and responsiveness.

The frontend interface is designed using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering a responsive layout that adjusts across devices. The user interface provides smooth interactions, including automatic message updates, scroll behavior, and message input management. Visual feedback, timestamps, and system-generated messages (like user join/leave events) were also added to enhance the user experience.

To ensure reliability, the app was tested in a multi-client environment, simulating several users communicating simultaneously. This involved validating connection handling, reconnection logic, and ensuring data consistency across all connected clients.

Additionally, the modular and clean codebase allows for easy extension — such as implementing private messaging, typing indicators, chat rooms, or message history using databases like MongoDB or Redis in future iterations.

This project demonstrates strong understanding of:

Real-time communication models

Event-driven programming

Client-server architecture

Network performance optimization

And practical application of Socket.io in production-grade systems
